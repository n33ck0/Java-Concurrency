## _{Java Concurrency with The Restaurant Problem (Based of The Classic Barbershop Problem}_

#### By _**{Isaias H., Saba A., and Mindy S.}**_

#### _{Brief description of application}_

## Technologies Used

* _Java_


## Description

_{This school project was to create a restaurant where customers will come in to. The restaurant has three waiters waiting on five different tales, and
there is one chef. The waiters seat the customers, take in the orders, bring the orders to the chef, then bring the cooked food to the table once it is ready. The customers eat, then leave the restaurant. Interfaces/ Abstracts must be used to design this project. Use at least one generic method or class, and the use of multithreading is a must. Show how this program runs with customers eating for random amounts of time}_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _There is no setup just one big Java.main file_


_{This is the initial upload, I'll try my best to continue honing and finessing this small little school project}_

## Known Bugs

* _So far, so good_


## License
	MIT
_{This code is based on the classic "Sleeping Barber Problem" which according to wikipedia: is a classic inter-process communication and synchronization problem illustrating the complexities arising when there are multiple OS processes.}_
